Difference between inheritance and composition
=> In object-oriented programming, we can use inheritance when we know there is an "is a" relationship between a child and its parent class. car is a vehicle would be a good example. 
We can use composition in cases where one object "has" (or is part of) another object. Example A car has a engine (engine is part of a car).


List Append vs List Extend
=> Append method is used when we want to add a single item to the end of a list.
we use this method if we need to append several items to a list as individual items. 
example nums = [1,2,3] nums.append(4) : o/p = [1,2,3,4]
new_values = [23,24,25] nums.extend(new_values) : o/p = [1,2,3,4,23,24,25]

If we try to pop more than the length of array it gives => IndexError: pop index out of range

Writing a python package
A must to remember:
    The Python package must have a unique name. No two existing Python packages can share the same name.
    The parent folder and sub-folder must have the same name, which is the name of our package.
    Inside the main file there are parameters name and packages. They also should have the same name as our package.
    Inside the main file there should be author_email parameter.

    To publish the package following commands to be run:
    $pip install setuptools and twine
    $python <filename> sdist
    $twine upload dist/*
    Go to PyPI, click on the account and go to Your Projects. If everything is fine you should see your package there. 
    To use the package
